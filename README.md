# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). Users can register and sign in to create tiny shortened URLs. There are also limited analytics that track how many times a link has been clicked and when it was clicked.
